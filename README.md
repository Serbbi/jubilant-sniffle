## Description

`Farm Game` is currently the name of my project, which is a tile based farming game. It is supposed to be a cute, relaxing game where you can plant crops, take care of animals and decorate your farm how you like it. There are many features I would like to add like: ambient sounds, a town square where you can do shopping, day and night cycle and many more. Right now the game is under development, not even version 0.1, which will contain: the basic terrain, free camera movement, an inventory, some tools to change the tiles and harvest crops and a couple of plants.

## Built With
